Checkout Cart helps you manage library-style inventories where items are 'checked out' or 'checked in' by recipients.
The cart interface allows you to quickly check out items to recipients, and check them back in. The extension is highly
configurable, and can be used for a variety of inventory management use cases.

To get started, install the extension on the Airtable marketplace, configure the extension in the settings tab, then
start using the checkout cart!
