Checkout Cart helps you manage library-style inventories where items are checked-out and checked-in by recipients.

The cart interface facilitates quick bulk transactions, while automatically recording check-out, check-in, and due
dates.
The extension can also auto-generate and configure the required tables and fields for you.

From tool/equipment libraries to book libraries, Checkout Cart can enhance a variety of library
inventory management workflows.

To get started, install the extension from the Airtable marketplace!

## Features

* Perform speedy bulk check-outs and check-ins.
* Auto-populate check-out and check-in dates for checkout records.
* Set a default due date for new checkouts or use a custom due date for each checkout.
* Auto-populate a "Cart Id" for checkout records, enabling grouping checkouts by cart.
* Enable deletion of checkout records upon check-in (optional).
* Bring your own Airtable schema or have the extension auto-generate and configure one for you.
